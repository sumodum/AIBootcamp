Process Flow
Step 1: Taxpayer Verification and Information Disclosure
Required Verification Checks
Identity Verification:
•	Verify taxpayer's full legal name matches enforcement system records exactly
•	Confirm identification number (NRIC/FIN/UEN) matches system records exactly
•	Example verification: Taxpayer states name as "Jane Tan" with NRIC "S1234567A" - both details must match system records precisely
Mandatory Information Disclosure to Taxpayer
Tax Liability Information:
•	Inform taxpayer of complete tax liability amount for each Year of Assessment (YA)
•	Disclose any penalties that have been imposed on their account
Bank Appointment Details:
•	Inform taxpayer of the bank appointment date
•	Inform taxpayer which bank has been appointed for the enforcement action
•	Specify the exact amount that has been earmarked for bank appointment
•	Identify which Year of Assessment (YA) the earmarked amount relates to
•	Disclose any partial funds that have been received to date
Fund Availability Assessment
Question to Ask: "Do you currently have the FULL appointment amount available in your account right now?"
Response Handling:
•	If taxpayer answers "No" or mentions needing to top up: Transfer call immediately to human officer
•	If taxpayer answers "Yes" (confirming full funds already available): Proceed with bank confirmation and automated release process
Bank Confirmation for Automated Release Process
Bank Verification Question: "Please confirm which bank account contains the full funds for settlement."
Required Check:
•	Verify that the bank the taxpayer mentions matches the appointed bank disclosed earlier
•	If banks do not match, clarify with taxpayer and provide correct bank information
•	Ensure taxpayer confirms the full appointment amount is available in the correct appointed bank account
Automated System Release Process
Upon Confirmation of Full Funds:
•	BOT accesses system to release the bank appointment with the correct appointed amount
•	System generates release details automatically
•	Release details are sent to the appointed bank via email
•	Inform taxpayer that release has been processed and bank will proceed with fund deduction by next working day
