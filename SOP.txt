Updated SOP for Bank Appointment Release Process
Document Scope and Application

Tax Type: IIT (Individual Income Tax) only

Case Type: Bank appointment cases

Entry Point: Taxpayers transferred after IVR triaging

Process Flow
Step 1: Taxpayer Verification and Information Disclosure
Required Verification Checks:

Identity Verification:

Confirm the taxpayer's NRIC/FIN/UEN: Verify the identity through the NRIC or UEN to ensure that the individual is the correct taxpayer.

Example: The system automatically extracts the NRIC and case number from the user’s input and verifies it against stored records.

Aligning with App: The chatbot automatically extracts and confirms the NRIC and Case Number from the user’s input (via regex extraction).

Mandatory Information Disclosure:

Tax Liability Information: The chatbot provides the taxpayer with their full tax liability amount for each Year of Assessment (YA).

Example: The chatbot responds with the tax details once it retrieves and filters the data from the tax records (based on the NRIC and Case Number).

Bank Appointment Information: The chatbot provides information about the appointed bank and funds earmarked for the appointment.

Aligning with App: After fetching tax records, the chatbot displays the appointed bank, amount, date, and Year of Assessment.

Step 2: Fund Availability Assessment

The chatbot will ask the taxpayer if the full appointment amount is available in their bank account:

Question: "Do you currently have the full appointment amount available in your account?"

If the user answers "No", the chatbot rejects the request and informs the user that they need to contact a human officer to resolve the issue.

If the user answers "Yes", the chatbot will proceed with asking the user for further information such as the bank name and account details.

Aligning with App: The chatbot checks if the user’s bank account and appointment amount match. If not, it will reject the request and inform the user.

Step 3: Bank Appointment Release

Once the full amount is confirmed, the chatbot proceeds to:

Request Bank Account Confirmation:

Question: "Please confirm the bank account that contains the full funds for settlement."

Verification: The system checks if the bank account entered by the user matches the appointed bank. It then checks if the full appointment amount is available.

Aligning with App: The system compares the bank account and funds available and either approves the release or asks for clarification if there is an issue.

System Processes Bank Appointment Release:

If all information is correct and no discrepancies are found, the chatbot initiates the bank appointment release.

The system generates the release details (amount, bank, and appointment date).

An automated email is sent to the bank to notify them of the release.

Aligning with App: The chatbot generates and sends an email to the bank, notifying them of the release. This is done automatically by the backend.

Step 4: Rejection Flow

If any of the conditions required for a bank appointment release are not met (e.g., incomplete information, insufficient funds, missing records), the system will:

Reject the Release:

If the tax records are incomplete or cannot be loaded, the chatbot will inform the user that no matching records could be found.

"⚠️ We could not find matching tax records for the provided NRIC and Case Number."

If payment evidence is not provided or funds are insufficient, the chatbot will reject the request.

"⚠️ The payment evidence or required funds are missing, please provide the necessary details."

Rejection Handling:

Guide the User: The chatbot will provide instructions on what additional information or steps the user must take to proceed.

Example: "Please upload your payment receipt and provide the full bank account details to proceed."

Aligning with App: The app will reject the bank release if the records or payment information are missing and ask the user for the missing details.

No Further Action: If rejection occurs, the chatbot will end the release process and wait for the user’s next action (e.g., further clarification or upload of required documents).

Aligning with App: The app's rejection logic ensures that the process halts when conditions are not met, and the user is prompted to supply the missing data.

Step 5: Email Notification to Bank

After successfully processing the bank release, the system automatically generates an email to notify the appointed bank.

The email will contain details like the taxpayer’s NRIC, Case Number, appointment amount, and the release confirmation.

Aligning with App: The email is generated and sent based on the bank's details retrieved from the user and processed within the chatbot’s conversation flow.

Key Information Requirements:

Tax Liability Details for each Year of Assessment (YA).

Bank Appointment Information (bank name, appointment amount, YA).

Confirmation of Full Funds Availability in the appointed bank account.

Payment Evidence (receipt, payment confirmation).

Bank Account Details for verification (last 4 digits).

Aligning with App: The chatbot ensures these details are either entered by the user or fetched automatically through the system.

Automated Actions:

Release Generation: Once all conditions are confirmed, the release is generated and sent to the bank.

Bank Email Notification: Automatically triggers an email to the appointed bank to notify them of the release.

Final Confirmation to User: After the release has been processed, the chatbot confirms to the user that the bank appointment release has been completed successfully.

Key Terms:

IIT: Individual Income Tax

Bank Appointment: The enforcement action where funds are earmarked from the appointed bank.

Full Funds: Full appointment amount already available in the bank account for the release.

Partial Funds: Any partial payments made that may not meet the required full amount.

Rejection Flow: When the chatbot determines that the required conditions are not met (e.g., insufficient funds, missing information), the process is rejected, and the user is guided to resolve the issue.

Summary of Updates:

Rejection Flow: Clearly defined how and when the chatbot will reject a request based on incomplete or missing information.

Chatbot Interface: Replaced any remaining call-based interactions with chatbot conversation flow for collecting user details and sending notifications.

Bank Appointment Release: Emphasized the automated email process and bank release confirmation that happens after successful processing.
