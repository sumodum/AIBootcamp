Updated SOP for Bank Appointment Release Process
Document Scope and Application

Tax Type: IIT (Individual Income Tax) only

Case Type: Bank appointment cases

Entry Point: Taxpayers transferred after IVR triaging

Process Flow
Step 1: Taxpayer Verification and Information Disclosure
Required Verification Checks:

Identity Verification:

Confirm the taxpayer's NRIC/FIN/UEN: Verify the identity through the NRIC or UEN to ensure that the individual is the correct taxpayer.

Example: The system automatically extracts the NRIC and case number from the user’s input and verifies it against stored records.

Aligning with App: The chatbot automatically extracts and confirms the NRIC and Case Number from the user’s input (via regex extraction).

Mandatory Information Disclosure:

Tax Liability Information: The chatbot provides the taxpayer with their full tax liability amount for each Year of Assessment (YA).

Bank Appointment Information: The chatbot provides information about the appointed bank and funds earmarked for the appointment.

Example Disclosure Format:
"Hello! Thank you for providing your NRIC and case number. I've retrieved your tax information.
I can see you have a bank appointment with DBS for S$750.00 made on 25 Mar 2025 for YA 2025.
Your total tax liability for YA 2025 is S$1250.00, and your current outstanding balance is S$0.00.

Would you like to proceed with the bank appointment release process?"

Aligning with App: After fetching tax records, the chatbot immediately discloses the appointed bank, appointment amount, appointment date, Year of Assessment, total tax liability, and current outstanding balance using actual values from the tax records (not placeholders).

Step 2: Fund Availability Assessment

The chatbot will ask the taxpayer if the full appointment amount is available in their appointed bank account:

Question Format (using actual values from tax records):
"Do you currently have the full appointment amount of S$750.00 available in your DBS account?"

Note: The chatbot must use the actual Appointment Amount and Appointed Bank name from the tax records, not placeholders.

If the user answers "No", the chatbot rejects the request immediately with this statement:
"We are unable to proceed with the bank appointment release as the full appointment amount is not available in your account. To explore alternative payment arrangements, please provide your contact number or email. An IRAS officer will contact you within three working days."

If the user answers "Yes", the chatbot will proceed to Step 3 (Bank Account Confirmation).

Aligning with App: The chatbot checks if the user confirms full funds availability. If not, the request is rejected and the user is provided with alternative contact options.

Step 3: Bank Account Confirmation

Once the user confirms full funds are available, the chatbot proceeds to verify bank account details.

The chatbot asks the following questions SEQUENTIALLY, one at a time:

Question 1: "Please confirm the bank account that contains the full funds. Which bank is this account with?"

Verification: If the bank name provided does not match the appointed bank, the chatbot asks for clarification.

Question 2: "Please provide the last 4 digits of your account number for verification."

Aligning with App: The chatbot asks questions one at a time, acknowledges each response, and verifies that the bank matches the appointed bank before proceeding.

Step 4: Release Determination and Summary Generation

Once all information is collected, the chatbot determines whether to APPROVE or REJECT the bank appointment release.

Approval Conditions (ALL must be met):
- Tax liability is fully settled OR full payment is confirmed
- User confirms full appointment amount is available
- Bank matches appointed bank
- All required information has been provided

If APPROVED:
- The chatbot generates a structured summary (see Summary Format below)
- CRITICAL: The chatbot MUST include the exact text "BANK_APPOINTMENT_RELEASE_APPROVED" in its response (this triggers the automated email notification system)
- An automated email is sent to the appointed bank to notify them of the release
- The user is informed that IRAS will notify the bank and the account will be released

If REJECTED:
- The chatbot generates a summary explaining what is missing
- The chatbot does NOT include "BANK_APPOINTMENT_RELEASE_APPROVED" in its response
- The user is guided on what additional information or steps are needed

Summary Format:
The chatbot must always produce this structured summary upon making the decision:

"Thank you for your cooperation.
Your request for bank appointment release is [APPROVED/REJECTED]
REASON: [Explanation]

Let me provide a summary of this case:

CASE DETAILS:
- NRIC: [NRIC]
- Case Number: [Case Number]
- Year of Assessment: [YA]

BANK APPOINTMENT INFORMATION:
- Appointed Bank: [Bank Name]
- Appointment Amount: S$[Amount]
- Appointment Date: [Date]

TAX LIABILITY STATUS:
- Total Payable: S$[Amount]
- Total Paid: S$[Amount]
- Current Balance: S$[Amount]

FUND AVAILABILITY:
- User confirmed: [YES/NO]

VERIFICATION:
- Bank Account Confirmed: [Bank Name]
- Account Details: [Last 4 digits]

[If APPROVED, add this exact line:]
BANK_APPOINTMENT_RELEASE_APPROVED

[Then add next steps:]
IRAS will send an official notification to [Bank Name] to release the bank appointment. You will be notified once the process is complete.

[If REJECTED, do NOT add the BANK_APPOINTMENT_RELEASE_APPROVED line. Instead, explain what is missing and what the user needs to do next]"

Aligning with App: The chatbot generates and sends an email to the bank automatically when approved. The user sees the bank appointment release status update to "In Progress" in My Tax Portal.

Step 5: Rejection Scenarios

The chatbot will reject the bank appointment release (with a structured summary) if any of the following conditions occur:

Rejection Conditions:
- Insufficient funds (user confirms funds are NOT available)
- Missing required information (e.g., bank account details not provided)
- Cannot load tax records (no matching NRIC and Case Number found)
- Bank mismatch (user's bank does not match appointed bank)
- Outstanding tax balance with no payment confirmation

Rejection Examples:

If no tax records found:
"⚠️ We could not find matching tax records for the provided NRIC and Case Number."

If insufficient funds:
"We are unable to proceed with the bank appointment release as the full appointment amount is not available in your account. To explore alternative payment arrangements, please provide your contact number or email. An IRAS officer will contact you within three working days."

If bank mismatch:
"The bank account you provided does not match the appointed bank. Please confirm the correct bank account details."

Aligning with App: The app's rejection logic ensures that the process halts when conditions are not met, the user receives a structured summary explaining what is missing, and is guided on next steps.

Step 6: Email Notification to Bank

After successfully processing the bank release, the system automatically generates an email to notify the appointed bank.

The email will contain details like the taxpayer’s NRIC, Case Number, appointment amount, and the release confirmation.

Aligning with App: The email is generated and sent based on the bank's details retrieved from the user and processed within the chatbot’s conversation flow.

Conversational Style Requirements:

The chatbot must follow these conversational guidelines:
- Ask one question at a time (do not list multiple questions in one message)
- Keep tone professional and friendly
- Acknowledge each user response before proceeding to the next question
- Track what information has been provided; do not repeat questions unnecessarily
- Use actual values from tax records, not placeholders or brackets

Key Information Requirements:

The following information is required for the bank appointment release process:
- Tax Liability Details for each Year of Assessment (YA)
- Bank Appointment Information (appointed bank name, appointment amount, appointment date, YA)
- Confirmation of Full Funds Availability in the appointed bank account
- Bank Account Details for verification (bank name and last 4 digits of account number)

Aligning with App: The chatbot ensures these details are either entered by the user or fetched automatically through the system. All values displayed to the user come from the tax_records.csv file, not from placeholders.

Automated Actions:

Release Generation: Once all conditions are confirmed, the release is generated and sent to the bank.

Bank Email Notification: Automatically triggers an email to the appointed bank to notify them of the release.

Final Confirmation to User: After the release has been processed, the chatbot confirms to the user that the bank appointment release has been completed successfully.

Key Terms:

IIT: Individual Income Tax

Bank Appointment: The enforcement action where funds are earmarked from the appointed bank.

Full Funds: Full appointment amount already available in the bank account for the release.

Partial Funds: Any partial payments made that may not meet the required full amount.

Rejection Flow: When the chatbot determines that the required conditions are not met (e.g., insufficient funds, missing information), the process is rejected, and the user is guided to resolve the issue.

Summary of Updates:

Rejection Flow: Clearly defined how and when the chatbot will reject a request based on incomplete or missing information.

Chatbot Interface: Replaced any remaining call-based interactions with chatbot conversation flow for collecting user details and sending notifications.

Bank Appointment Release: Emphasized the automated email process and bank release confirmation that happens after successful processing.
